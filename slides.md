## What is Hygge?


`Hygge [ˈh(j)uːɡə]` is a Danish and Norwegian word for a mood of coziness and comfortable conviviality with feelings of wellness and contentment.


If you were to ask a Danish person precisely what hygge means, he or she would clarify that it doesn’t mean just one concept. Instead, there are numerous elements that comprise this way of living, and you may already be doing some of them unknowingly.
